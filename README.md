# Fluid Simulation

A 2D Eularian fluid simulation  based on Jos Stam's paper *[Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/847f/819a4ea14bd789aca8bc88e85e906cfc657c.pdf)*, implemented in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

My solver is GPU based, and can easily handle grids of at least 1024 Ã— 1024 resolution at 60 fps.
I also provide a CPU implementation, for reference.
